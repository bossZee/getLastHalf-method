# getLastHalf-method
Design and implement a getLastHalf() method for the MyLinkedList class. The method should return the last half of the list as a new list leaving the original list intact. If the list has an uneven number of elements the extra one element must be in the list returned.  Example : [1,3,5,4] return [5,4] and [1,6,9] return [6,9].  Follow the three step method for designing the method  Develop the java code for the method

The method created does not work and also does not return anything. Did not test odd and even.
